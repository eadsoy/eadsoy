# Hi there<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eadsoy/eadsoy/main/gifs/hi.gif" width="30px">
##### I'm Esin, a fullstack developer, born in Germany, spent half my life there, the other half in Turkey.
- :world_map: I'm currently based in Istanbul, Turkey.
- :woman_student: I studied  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :closed_book: Architecture  at Istanbul Technical University,  
  very recently  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :bus: graduated a coding bootcamp (Le Wagon)  
  and enrolled in the  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :open_book: Mathematics Engineering/ Applied Maths program at Yildiz Technical University for a second bachelors.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently:
    - part of a volunteer dev team of three, creating a platform for students enrolled in different European universities.
    - working on our first freelance project with two fellow Le Wagon alumni,
    - working on a side project, whose link will appear right here very soon I hope.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eadsoy/eadsoy/main/gifs/react.png" width="30px">
